			<p>You are given a positive integer N, and two single-digit integers p and q, where p != q and both are greater than 1. You must output all of the integers from 1 to N inclusive, separated by a single space.
				However, any integer divisible by p whose decimal representation does not contain the digit p should be replaced by the text WAT and any integer divisible by q whose decimal representation does not contain the digit q should be replaced by the text SON. Integers for which both of the preceding statements are true should instead be replaced by the text WATSON.</p>

			Input
			<p>A single line on standard input per testcase: N p q</p>

			Output
			<p>The space-separated sequence as described above (only numbers and uppercase chars), with no leading or trailing spaces.</p>
